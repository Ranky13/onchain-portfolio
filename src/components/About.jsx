        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>
          As a specialized On-Chain Analyst and Web3 Researcher (Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate), 
          I focus exclusively on blockchain-native data to deliver actionable intelligence in the decentralized ecosystem.
          I leverage Power BI for advanced visualization and automation, SQL (via platforms like Dune Analytics) for custom blockchain queries,
           Python (Pandas & related libraries) for data processing and ETL, alongside leading on-chain intelligence tools such as Nansen, Glassnode, 
           Arkham, and others to design interactive, automated dashboards that uncover wallet behaviors, transaction flows, smart-money patterns, 
           liquidity metrics, TVL dynamics, whale movements, and protocol fundamentals.
